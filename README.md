### **Task 1 (Learn some command line, server and http tools):**

1. "Linux Command Line Basics" course

	I have Ubuntu as my second OS. So I've already been familiar with Linux terminal and have used several shell commands. So it was easy to compleate this course.

2. "Configuring Linux Web Servers" course

	It was realy a challenge for me to complete the next two courses, although some themes wasn't completely new to me. A lot of new programs and shell commands forced me to re-read and re-watch the material for several times. I honestly tried to figure out how everything worked, but the information of that kind is really hard to understand. And the main conclusion I've made is that I'll need to search for some additional information on these themes and maybe even go back to these courses in some time later.

4. Articles "HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1" and "HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2".

	It was interesting to get to know about the difference between the types of connections in HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 versions. 
	The status codes, request\response headers, all of these I will definatelly see and use in my future researches and work.
